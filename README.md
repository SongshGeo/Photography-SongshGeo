## üì∑ Professional Photography Workflow

### Complete Pipeline: From Camera to Website

This repository contains a streamlined workflow for professional photographers to publish travel photos with precise GPS geotagging and automated website generation.

#### üîß Prerequisites

1. **Lightroom Classic** with plugins:
   - [Jeffrey's Geotag Support Plugin](http://regex.info/blog/lightroom-goodies/gps)
   - [JF Collection Publisher](https://regex.info/blog/lightroom-goodies/collection-publisher)

2. **Command-line tools**:
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   brew install exiftool
   pip3 install --user --break-system-packages geopy gpxpy
   ```

#### üìã Step-by-Step Workflow

##### Step 1: Photo Preprocessing in Lightroom

1. **Import and organize**:
   - Import camera photos from your trip
   - Create smart collections by date range
   - Flag picks (P key) and rate 4+ stars for selection

2. **Create copyright preset**:
   ```
   Copyright: ¬© 2025 SongshGeo
   Creator: SongshGeo
   Creator URL: https://songshgeo.github.io/Photography-SongshGeo/
   Keywords: photography, travel, [country], [city]
   ```
   - Apply preset to all selected photos

##### Step 2: GPS Track Generation

1. **Find phone photos** from the same date range with GPS data

2. **Generate GPX track**:
   ```bash
   # Extract GPS from phone photos
   ./scripts/extract-mac-photos-gps.sh
   
   # Convert to GPX format
   python3 scripts/json2gpx.py mac-photos-gps.json phone-track.gpx
   ```

##### Step 3: Geotagging in Lightroom

1. **Load GPS track**:
   - File > Plug-in Extras > Geoencoding Support > Load Track Log
   - Select your GPX file
   - Plugin automatically matches GPS to photos by timestamp

2. **Reverse geocoding**:
   - Use Jeffrey's plugin to lookup addresses from GPS coordinates
   - This fills City/Country/State fields automatically

##### Step 4: Smart Collection Publishing

1. **Set up Collection Publisher**:
   - Create published folder: `content/trips/`
   - Configure naming: `{date (yyyy)}-{date (mm)}-{date (dd)}-{sequence (0001)}`
   - Set export settings: JPEG quality 85%, 2560px long edge

2. **Create smart collections**:
   ```
   Collection Name: [Country] - [City] - [Year]
   Filter: Country = [Country] AND City = [City] AND Flag = Pick
   ```

3. **Publish collections**:
   - Drag photos to appropriate collections
   - Right-click collection > "Publish"
   - Photos automatically export to `content/trips/[Country]/`

##### Step 5: Website Generation

1. **Create trip index** (copy template):
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "[City], [Country] [Year]"
   date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
   location:
     country: [Country]
     city: [City]
   coords:
     lat: [latitude]
     lon: [longitude]
   cover: [filename].jpg
   tags: [landscape, travel, [country]]
   ---
   ```

2. **Build and deploy**:
   ```bash
   # Test locally
   hugo server --buildDrafts
   
   # Commit and push (auto-deploys to Vercel)
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add [Country] trip photos"
   git push origin main
   ```

#### üéØ Workflow Benefits

- ‚úÖ **Precise GPS tagging**: Phone GPS + camera photos = accurate locations
- ‚úÖ **Automated organization**: Smart collections sort by location automatically  
- ‚úÖ **Professional metadata**: Copyright, keywords, and location data included
- ‚úÖ **One-click publishing**: Collection Publisher handles file naming and export
- ‚úÖ **Version control**: All photos tracked in Git with proper history
- ‚úÖ **SEO optimized**: Automatic sitemap and metadata for search engines

#### üìö Advanced Features

- **Batch processing**: Handle hundreds of photos in minutes
- **Reverse geocoding**: Automatic city/country lookup from coordinates
- **Smart collections**: Dynamic filtering by date, location, rating
- **Template system**: Consistent photo metadata across all trips

### Adding Photos Manually

To add photos to an existing album:

1. Copy image files to the appropriate directory (e.g., `content/nature/`)
2. The theme automatically creates gallery pages from images in album directories
3. Optionally add metadata in the album's `index.md` frontmatter

To create a new album:

1. Create a new directory under `content/`
2. Add an `index.md` file with album metadata
3. Add image files to the directory
