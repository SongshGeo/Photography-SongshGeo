# Photography by SongshGeo

> *"A geographer who also travels."*

Welcome to my photography gallery! I'm **Shuang Song**, a scientist by profession and photographer by passion. As a researcher studying the co-evolution between human society and natural environments, my camera becomes both a tool for documentation and artistic expression.

This collection showcases images captured during my travels and research journeys across different landscapes and cultures. From the dramatic natural environments that shape civilizations to the urban spaces where modern life unfolds, each photograph tells part of a larger story about our relationship with the world around us.
