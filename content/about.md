# About Me

I'm SongshGeo, a passionate photographer who loves capturing the beauty of the world through my lens. This gallery showcases my work across different genres and subjects.

## Photography Philosophy

Every photograph tells a story. Whether it's a fleeting moment in nature, the hustle and bustle of city life, or intimate portraits, I strive to capture the essence of each subject and share it with viewers.

## Equipment & Technique

I work with various camera systems and lenses, always adapting my approach to suit the subject matter and lighting conditions. My post-processing workflow emphasizes bringing out the natural beauty while maintaining authenticity.
