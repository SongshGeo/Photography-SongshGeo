# About Me

üëã Hello! I'm **Shuang Song**, also known as **SongshGeo** or **Twist** - a geographer who also travels.

I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology](https://www.gea.mpg.de/) in Jena, Germany, where I work across two departments: the Department of Structural Changes of the Technosphere and the Department of Co-evolution of Land Use and Urbanisation.

## My Scientific Journey

My research primarily uses water as a link to study the co-evolution between human society and the natural environment. With an interdisciplinary background in Physical Geography and the Study of History, I focus on the long-term evolution of water management systems and their impact on human society, particularly in the Yellow River Basin, China.

I'm passionate about developing tools for the research community - I created the open-source Agent-based Modeling framework [ABSESpy](https://github.com/SongshGeoLab/ABSESpy) and lead the [PaperBell team](https://paperbell.cn/), which develops academic note-taking workflows based on Obsidian.

## Photography & Travel

Beyond my scientific work, I'm an avid traveler and photographer. My camera accompanies me on research trips and personal journeys, capturing the intersection of human society and natural environments that I study professionally. Whether it's the dramatic landscapes that shape civilizations, the urban environments where modern life unfolds, or the people whose stories connect us all, I seek to document the world through both a scientific and artistic lens.

## My Philosophy

As I wrote on my blog: "My life is a road movie, and these films usually share a common theme - questioning the direction of progress. But as a geographer, I have no choice but to keep moving forward."

Every photograph in this gallery tells part of that ongoing journey - moments of discovery, reflection, and wonder captured while exploring our complex world.
