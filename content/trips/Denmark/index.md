# Denmark

A journey through the serene landscapes and modern urban environments of Denmark. These photographs capture the unique character of Scandinavian design and natural beauty, from coastal scenes to contemporary architecture.

As a geographer, I was particularly drawn to how Danish cities seamlessly integrate with their natural surroundings, creating harmonious urban-nature relationships that reflect the country's environmental consciousness.
